            <p>
              For most of us, the Living Room is where we spend the most time,
              but finding the right look for your space can be a challenge. Read
              the design stories from real customers and learn more about how
              they designed their living room online. See how weâ€™ve helped them
              and get inspired with these behind-the-scenes looks at some of our
              favorite living room transformations.
